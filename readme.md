# widschi-bot

Telegram bot for assigning chores with my flatmates. Loops through all names randomly and spits out a name on command.

## Usage

Put the names of all people in `app/names.json`, e.g. `["RÃ¼diger","Kunigunde","Karsten"]`. Obtain a telegram token for your bot by contacting the `@BotFather` telegram account, and expose it as an environment variable named `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`.

Add your bot to any group and call the `/next` command.
